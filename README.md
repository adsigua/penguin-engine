## Penguin Engine
##### by Adonis Sigua

This is the beginning of me learning Vulkan and eventually Game Engine Development.  
The goal of this project is for me to expand my knowledge in game dev, specially with graphics programming.  
  
#### The major targets of this project are the following:
+ Vulkan Rendering Engine (start with basic PBR, forward and deffered then raytracing/path tracing)  
+ IMGUI  
+ Basic profiler  
+ Model Animations  
+ Basic physics engine  
+ Particle System  
+ Entity Component System  
  
#### Smaller but important to-dos:
+ Clean up project in general  
+ Make a better readme  
  
#### Far-off goals:
+ Reimplement rendering engine on different apis (mainly directx and opengl, but maybe on other web apis as well)  
+ Implement more game-engine systems, and maybe convert the project to a game engine entirely
